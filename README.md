# Credit API

This API is part of a job application test. 

It has two different uses on the same (and only) route. It returns the three best credit offers from institutions if all parameter values are provided â€” or fewer, if no full matches are found.

CPFs available:
* 111.111.111-11 
* 123.123.123.12 
* 222.222.222.22

More about the routes and general information in: (will add the url here if/when i deploy it online, you can use the local one instead)
